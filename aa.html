<h2> weight-trainging</h2>
  <u>Weight training is a common type of strength training
    for developing the strength
    and size of skeletal muscles.  </u>
   It utilizes the <strong>force</strong> of gravity
   in the form of weighted bars,
  dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated
   by muscle through
  concentric or eccentric contraction.
  Building and maintaining muscle is necessary for all of us, especially as we age.
   And the earlier we start, the better.
<br><br>According to the American Council on Exercise,
 most adults lose nearly a half pound of muscle per year starting around age 30,
 mostly because they aren’t as active as they were when they were younger.
