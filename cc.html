<h2> leg-trainging</h2>
  What is the true indication of a great physique?
   Is it large, peaked biceps? <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/5-leg-workouts-for-mass-a-beginners-guide.html"target="_blank"
   title "leg press"> Is it razor-sharp abs? </a>
   Is it bowling-ball shoulders or a wide thick back?
  <br><br><br>  None of those are correct.
     The real answer is, symmetry.
     <p> A "Symmetrical Physique" is one in which all body parts flow into each other.
   No one body part or side of the body is bigger than the other. </P>
